# My first Git respository

Hello, my name is Yen Nee, and I'm learning Git and Python. Here is my first GitHub repository.

I plan to upload my first written python program which generator password into this responsitory.

Success is the sum of small efforts, repeated day in and day out.
成功就是日复一日那一点点小小努力的积累。

Thanks for reading!
